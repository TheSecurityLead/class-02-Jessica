# LAB - Class 02

## About Me

I built an app that tells the user about me.  It includes a short biography and a list of a few of my favorite things.  It also quizzes the user visiting the site, through a series of promts, with the purpose of them learning about me.

### Reflections and Comments

* I struggled a bit with the if statements and switch statement trying to make "yes" and "y" work correctly in the prompts.  It took me longer then I would have liked (finished outside of lab hours) but I was proud of myself for reviewing the lecture and demo in GitHub repo to figure it out.
* Primarily worked through this lab on my own but did chat and collaborate with class members at my table.  Requested help from TA to verify my (and other table members) folder structure was setup correctly.
